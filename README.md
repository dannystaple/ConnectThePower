===============

A python game requiring you to wire stuff up. Uses pygame.

Status: Not touched in 10 years. Unlikely to be complete or working with current python/pygame versions.

Needs:
- To be roadmapped properly - what did I mean it to do? Basically a pipes type game with electrical wire sections - 
segments like T juntions, elbows, straight through and crosses. With different voltages signals, don't cross the wires! 
Kaboom. Timer or limited tile dynamics for game difficulty. Hopefully some colourful simple graphics.
- It has tests - they should probably be checeked in a workflow/commit hook along with lints.
- Screenshots - what does it even do so far?
- Maybe can have lights, logic or machinees that run whent eh power is connected. Silly fun back story. Sound FX, title 
screen etc - polish. 
- Perhaps have stages of development in branches, suitable for use in a coder dojo where branches can be updated out. Need 
to consider that model.


Intention would be for this to serve in coderdojo's - so may convert to the now far simpler pygamezero - it seems likely 
that this would work there. Also may be able to use free game/kenney Nl assets if there are suitable ones.
